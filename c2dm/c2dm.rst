Electronic structure of 2D materials
------------------------------------

The structures were first relaxed using the PBE xc-functional and a 18x18x1 k-point sampling until all forces on the atoms where below 0.01 eV/Ã…. The rows with xc='PBE' contains data from these calculations.

For materials that were found to be semiconducting in the PBE calculations we furthermore performed calculations using the LDA and GLLB-SC xc functionals and the lattice constants and atom positions found from the PBE calculation. For these calculations we used a 30x30x1 k-point sampling. For the GLLB-SC calculations we calculated the derivative discontinuity and have added this contribution to the electronic band gaps. Data for these calculations are found in rows with xc='GLLBSC' and xc='LDA', respectively.

Furthermore, we calculated the G0W0 quasiparticle energies using the wavefunctions and eigenvalues from the LDA calculations and a plane-wave cut-off energy of at least 150 eV. The quasiparticle energies where further extrapolated to infinite cut-off energy via the methods described in the paper. The LDA rows thus further have key-value pairs with the results from the G0W0 calculations.

Dielectric building blocks
---------------------------

The dielectric building blocks of the materials, that can be used to build van
der Waals heterostructures, is obtained from the file
:download:`chi-data.tar.gz`. This contains a pickle file for each material
with the data described below:

=====================  =======================================================
quantity                  description
=====================  =======================================================
q                      Grid for parallel momentum transfers

frequencies            frequency grid

chi_monopole           Monopole density response function, array of dimension
                       (q x frequencies)

chi_dipole             Dipole density response function, array of dimension
                       (q x frequencies)

The quantum electrostatic heterostructure (QEH) model
-----------------------------------------------------

The dielectric function of van der waals heterostructures and associated
properties can be calculated with the python module in the script, *qeh.py*,
that can be downloaded from here: :download:`qeh.py`, and is also available
trough GPAW.

As an example the macroscopic dielectric function of multilayer MoS2 can be
obtained. First we extract the data for MoS2 from the database::

    $ tar xf chi-data.tar.gz
    $ cp chi-data/H-MoS2-chi.pckl .
    
Then the Heterostructure module is used to calculate the dielectric function
for one to 20 layers of MoS2.

.. literalinclude:: multi_MoS2.py
    :start-after: Calculate

Which should return this result:

.. image:: epsMoS2.svg

The structure is set up with the structure parameter, that should be a list of
speciems within the structure. In this case ``structure=['20MoS2']`` gives 20
layers of MoS2. As an example a more complicated heterostructure of graphene,
hBN and MoS2 can be set up with: ``structure=['3H-MoS2', '2BN','graphene',
'2BN', '3H-MoS2']``, which will give one layer of graphene sandwiched between
two layers of hBN and three layers of MoS2 on each side. The d parameter
should be a list of the distance bewteen all neigboring layers, with a length
equal to N-1, where N is the number of layers in the structure.
