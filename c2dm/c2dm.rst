Electronic structure of 2D materials
------------------------------------

The structures were first relaxed using the PBE xc-functional and a 18x18x1 k-point sampling until all forces on the atoms where below 0.01 eV/Ã…. The rows with xc='PBE' contains data from these calculations.

For materials that were found to be semiconducting in the PBE calculations we furthermore performed calculations using the LDA and GLLB-SC xc functionals and the lattice constants and atom positions found from the PBE calculation. For these calculations we used a 30x30x1 k-point sampling. For the GLLB-SC calculations we calculated the derivative discontinuity and have added this contribution to the electronic band gaps. Data for these calculations are found in rows with xc='GLLBSC' and xc='LDA', respectively.

Furthermore, we calculated the G0W0 quasiparticle energies using the wavefunctions and eigenvalues from the LDA calculations and a plane-wave cut-off energy of at least 150 eV. The quasiparticle energies where further extrapolated to infinite cut-off energy via the methods described in the paper. The LDA rows thus further have key-value pairs with the results from the G0W0 calculations.
